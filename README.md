# dotfiles
- Settings for 
    - sway with i3status-rust & wmenu
    - foot (terminal)
    - zsh (shell)
    - swaync (Notifications)
    - other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
